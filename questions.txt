1.  stdint.h is a standard C library header file having fixed-width integer data types.
2.  Using well-defined types like uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t makes the code far easier and safer to port independent of different platforms.
3.  BYTE: 8 bits ie 1 byte,
    DWORD: 32 bits ie 4 bytes,
    LONG: 32 bits ie 4 bytes, and
    WORD: 16 bits ie 2 bytes.
4.  BM (0x424d) which is the file type i.e., bftype.
5.  bfSize is the total number of bytes in the file.
    biSize is the number of bytes in the info header ie 40 bytes.
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.
7.  The biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure determines the number of bits that define each pixel 
    and the maximum number of colors in the bitmap.
8.  fopen might return NULL value when there is no existing file (infile) to read or no file (outfile) created to write. 
9.  Because fread will read the total number of bytes in BITMAPFILEHEADER or BITMAPINFOHEADER only one time.
10. The value of padding will be 3 bytes if bi.biWidth is 3.
11. fseek is used to change the location of the file pointer in a file.
12. SEEK_CUR indicates the current position of the position pointer.
